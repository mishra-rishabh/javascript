# VARIABLES IN JS

<b>What is a variable?</b>
* Variables are used to store the information.
* A variable is a “named storage” for data.
* A variable in JavaScript is a named container for storing data.
* It can be used to store any type of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions.
* Variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.

<b>var:</b> It is the oldest keyword for declaring variables, and it is still supported in modern JavaScript. However, it has some limitations, such as its scope.
<b>let:</b> It is a newer keyword that was introduced in ES6. It has a few advantages over var, such as block scope and preventing accidental re-assignment.
<b>const:</b> It is a keyword that was also introduced in ES6. It is used to declare constants, which are variables that cannot be changed after they are initialized.


<b>Naming Convention</b>
There are three limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
2. The first character must not be a digit.
3. It should not contain any reserved keyword.

* The most common convention is to use camelCase. This means that the first word of the variable name is lowercase, and subsequent words start with a capital letter. For example, the variable "myName" would be written in camelCase.

* Another common convention is to use snake_case. This means that all words in the variable name are lowercase, and they are separated by underscores. For example, the variable "my_name" would be written in snake_case.
