Expresions are any value inside JS that you can assign to a variable, constant. It can also become a JS program by itself.
For eg. !true is itself a JS program which will return false.

We do computation in most of the cases inside any program. And to do these kind of computations we have to use operators.
For eg. 10 + 2  = 12; 10, 2 are operands, + is an operator and 12 is a result.
